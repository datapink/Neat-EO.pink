In brief go to: <a href="https://neat-EO.pink">neat-EO.pink</a>


<hr />

Laconic long-version:

To avoid any issue related to US Export Administration Regulations,
we removed neat-EO and former RoboSat.pink repositories, from GitHub (and PyPi).

Public <a href="https://neat-EO.pink">neat-EO</a> project, is hence on <a href="https://datapink.io">our gitea</a> under French laws.
